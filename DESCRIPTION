Title: Significance Analysis for Clustering Single-Cell RNA-seq Data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Isabella N. Grabski
Maintainer: Isabella N. Grabski <isabellagrabski@g.harvard.edu>
Description: We introduce a model-based hypothesis testing approach for 
    evaluating single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) clusters. This approach is 
    implemented in two ways: (1) a stand-alone clustering pipeline with built-in 
    hypothesis testing to produce clusters corresponding to distinct cell 
    populations and (2) a post-hoc method that can evaluate the statistical 
    significance of any provided set of clusters.
